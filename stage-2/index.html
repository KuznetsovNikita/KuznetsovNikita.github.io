                <p>Charts support mouse and tap events. For all 5 charts, I implemented the zoom-in and zoom-out
                    functionality. To switch the zoom you need to click on the pop-up, to fix the pop-up in one place
                    during mouse events - click on the chart.</p>
                <p>I want to convey my thanks. I really liked to participate in the event and I learned a lot of new
                    things about myself and about the front-end development. Thank you Telegram Team.</p>
                <p>Enjoy,<br />Nikita Kuznetsov.</p>
