### Requirements

Telegram official coding competition for Android, iOS and JS developers. 

The goal is to develop software for showing simple charts based on input data we provide. You can use either JavaScript, Android Java or iOS Swift. 

Note: you may not use specialized charting libraries. All the code you submit must be written by you from scratch.

The criteria weâ€™ll be using to define the winner are speed, efficiency and the size of the app.

The app should show 5 charts on one screen, based on the input data we will provide within the next 24 hours.

Designs for the contest charts are attached below.

Stay tuned for contest-related announcements in this channel.

Good luck!
